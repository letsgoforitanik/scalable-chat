# Scalable Group Chat Application

This is a sample placement cell application. Employees need to sign up first before using the application.
Employees can save students information. They can also record interview information, placement information
and download placement report in `.csv` format.

This is a group chat application. The objective of developing this application was to examine web-socket scaling.
Websockets don't scale. That's why redis was used for inter server communication.

Technologies used in the project - Kafka, Redis, Prisma, Postgres, Turborepo
